## Overview
- functions/functions.R: The functions that do the estimation with the EM algorithm.
- simulation_code/simulation.R: The file that runs the simulation. This takes a loong time.
The results of the simulation are saved in the file intermediate_results/simresults.rds.
- simulation_code/table1.R: This file generates Table1 from the paper using the 
results from the simulation, i.e. the intermediate_results/simresults.rds data. 
The file is exported to results/table1.tex.
- results/table1.tex: The results as they are in the paper.

## Environment
```{r}
